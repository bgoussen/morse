\section{Introduction}
  This \texttt{R} compagnon provides several tools for ecotoxicologists and regulators based on advanced and innovative methods for a valuable
quantitative environmental risk assessment.
It allows the analysis of bioassay reproduction data accounting for mortality
all along the bioassay.
Such data are commonly used to estimate Effective Concentration ($EC_{x}$) values from chronic toxicity tests.
The aim is to fit an exposure-response curve to reproduction data by Bayesian
inference while taking into account mortality among parents without loosing
valuable data \cite{Delignette-Muller}.
Models are characterized by a deterministic log-logistic part associated with a stochastic part.
Two different stochastic parts can be chosen: Poisson or Gamma-Poisson.
This \texttt{R} compagnon also allows the analysis of bioassay survival data at the final time. Such data are commonly used to estimate
Lethal Concentration ($LC_{x}$) values from chronic toxicity tests. The aim is to fit an exposure-response curve to survival
data by Bayesian inference.
Models are characterized by a deterministic log-logistic  part with 2 or 3 parameters associated with a binomial stochastic part.
The number of parameters depending on the mortality in the control at the final time.

The aim of this document is to provide examples showing how to use these tools
that help to analyse ecotoxicological bioassay data by a bayesien approach.

\subsection{Theory}

    To fit an exposure-response curve an reproduction data, it is necessary to
  choose the best model corresponding to the data. Here only the log-logistic
  model is proposed, but with the choice beetween two stochastic parts (...).
